/*
Complicated objects (e.g., cars) arent designed from scratch
- they reiterate existing designs

An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype

We make a copy of the prototype and customize it
- requires deep copy support

We make the cloning convenient

A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and
make use of.
